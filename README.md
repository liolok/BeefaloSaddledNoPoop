## Proudly Discontinued due to Official Adoption

*Beefalo no longer poop **while being ridden*** since [release 445759][update] on December 17 of 2020.

It's an honor that my little change is (in some way) accepted and done by Klei.

Have fun playing!

# Beefalo Tamed No Poop

![mod icon](docs/images/modicon.png)

This is a mod for Klei's game [Don't Starve Together][dst], it prevents **tamed** beefalo from pooping around.

> Note that if goes feral, it will start to drop manure again. But we don't let it go feral, do we? ;P
